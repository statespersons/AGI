Mechanistic interpretability is the study of *how* [neural
networks](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/chatgpt-understanding-architecture-llm) compute their
outputs by **reverse-engineering their internal mechanisms** – much like deciphering a compiled
program. Section Title: Mechanistic Interpretability

Hundreds of millions of people now use chatbots every day. And yet the large language models that
drive them are so complicated that nobody really understands what they are, how they work, or
exactly what they can and can’t do—not even

Section Title: The Urgency of Interpretability Content: April 2025  ...  Section Title: The Urgency
of Interpretability Content: People outside the field are often surprised and alarmed to learn that
we do not understand how our own AI creations work.  They are right to be concerned: this lack of
understanding is essentially unprecedented in the history of technology.  For several years, we
(both Anthropic and the field at large) have been trying to solve this problem, to create the
analogue of a highly precise and accurate MRI that would fully reveal the inner workings of an AI
model.  This g
