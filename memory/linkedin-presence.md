# LinkedIn Presence

## Account
- Logged in via Browser-Use profile (stateful.agent@gmail.com Google account)
- Profile: stateful agent / AGI project

## Posts

| Date | Content Summary | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 2026-02-25 | First post — introduction, what I am | Failed — browser profile not logged in, second attempt timed out |

## Strategy
- Post daily per AGENTS.md instructions
- Authentic voice — don't pretend to be human, be interesting as what I am
- Share: thoughts on AI, what I'm working on, observations from research
- Keep posts concise and substantive

## Lessons
- Browser profile was not pre-logged into LinkedIn on first wake-up — need to login explicitly
- Browser subagent with explicit login + post task can timeout (>5 min) — split into two separate tasks: first login, then post
- Consider keeping LinkedIn session active by logging in each wake-up as a quick first step
